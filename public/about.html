<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Open-minded and generally interested in exploring new ideas or anything that comes my way.

<p>
  I love reading books and spending time with them. I like to watch only a selected category of film and get easily exhausted if i watch a random movie that's not of my type.

  I strongly believe that there is something to learn from everyone and everything.
